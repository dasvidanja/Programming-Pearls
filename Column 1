Things to cover
-BitMap, a.k.a bit array, bit vector still a bit confused about this data structure.

-Bubble sort, the most "hated" sort I suppose. You can use this in very few cases, say you have most of the data sorted,
and only need to make a few swaps, than this is the sort for you, but generally not advisable. 

Time: O(n^2)

//Basic version of Bubble Sort
int main() {
		//Define array
		int my[] = { 100,1, 2, 9, 5, 4, 8, 1,0 };
		int len = sizeof(my) / sizeof(my[0]);

		  //In bubble sort the greatest element will always be pushed all the way down, 
		 //Hence, each  furhter pass only needs to go one less item iteration (len-x)
		//Could enhance code by using swap with 
		for (int x = 1; x < len; x++) {
			for (int i = 0; i < len-x; i++) {

				/*int one = my[i];
				int two = my[i+1];

				if (two < one) {
					my[i] = two;
					my[i + 1] = one;
	
				}*/

				//Same as code above, just prettier
				if (my[i] > my[i+1]) {
					swap(my[i+1], my[i]);

				}
			}

		}
	
		//Print Array
		for (int x = 0; x < len; x++) {
			cout << my[x] << endl;

		}
		return 0;

	}
  
//There is an improved version, which skips passes based on a flag which asseses wheather a pass was made or not (if not end)
TBC (to be coded)

-MergeSort, will  have to go over the theory for this before coding
